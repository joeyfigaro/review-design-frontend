What is Middleware?
Middleware is a function that receives the request and response objects of an HTTP request/response cycle. It may modify (transform) these objects before passing them to the next middleware function in the chain. It may decide to write to the response; it may also end the response without continuing the chain.

In other frameworks “middleware” is called “filters”, but the concept is the same: a request, response, and some transformation functions.

A very simple middleware function looks like this:

function logger(req,res,next){
  console.log(new Date(), req.method, req.url);
  next();
}

The job of Express is to manage your chain of middleware functions. All middleware should achieve three things:

It should be a function that does something awesome
It’s well-documented
It can be easily mixed into your existing Express application
